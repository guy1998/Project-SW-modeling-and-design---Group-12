The purpose of this specification is to provide an evaluative insight into the current state of product design. It will also serve as a document to keep track of all the activities and processes related to the planning and drafting of each element of the project. The target audience of this specification is the development team and stakeholders such as investors or managing parties.  
Within the scope of this documentation lie all aspects of the planning process discussed in detail such as:
	Features and functionalities included in the product.	

	An outline of the application’s processes and interface.	

	User characteristics, constraints, dependencies and assumptions. (All discussed in part 2 of the specification)	

	List of requirements alongside evaluation and ranking. (Discussed in part 3)	

	Full requirements’ description based on the type and importance of each requirement. (Discussed in part 3)	

	Detailed information for the flow of action and flow of data within the application.

	User scenarios and descriptions of how the user will be able to operate the system. (Use case diagrams and use case explanations discussed in the last part of the specification)
There are other aspects that fall outside of the scope including:
	Financial considerations including but not limited to: financial outcome calculations, auditing, cost of each feature, etc.	

	 Issues related to product liability such as terms and agreements. (Note that we do refer to the inclusion of terms and agreements as a legal requirement, but the content of such legislative documentation will not be part of the project specification)	

	Anything related to product marketing	

Note: All the items that are not within the boundaries of the scope are either already dealt with by other parties included in the project or are not a direct responsibility of the project development team.
